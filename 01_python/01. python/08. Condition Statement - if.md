In Python, the `if` statement lets your code make decisions: it runs a block of code only when a certain condition is `True`.

```python
if condition:
    # code to run if condition is True
    print("Condition is true")
```


example
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
    print("Can vote and play online games")

```
