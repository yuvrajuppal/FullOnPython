## While Loop

A while loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition remains true. It's ideal when you don't know the exact number of iterations upfront, unlike a for loop.

### Syntax
```
while condition:
    # Code block to execute
    # Must update condition variable to avoid infinite loops
```
The condition is checked before each iteration; if false, the loop exits.

### Basic Example
This prints numbers from 1 to 5:
```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

## For in Loop
Python's `for...in` loop iterates over elements of sequences like lists, tuples, strings, or ranges. It's perfect for known iteration counts, unlike while loops which we discussed earlier.

```
for variable in iterable:
    # Code block to execute
```

```python
for x in range(0,11):
print(x)

for x in range(0,11,2):
print(x)

fruits = ["apple","mango","pomigranet"]
for item in fruits:
print(item)

for item in reversed(fruits):
print(item)
```
