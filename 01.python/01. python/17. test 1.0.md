## Practice Questions

Test your knowledge with these 5 practical challenges:

1. **The Multiplier:** Write a script that takes a user's input (integer), multiplies it by `5.0`, and prints the result. What is the **data type** of the final result?
    
2. **The Login Logic:** Create a program that asks for a username and a password. Use a **logical operator** to print "Login Successful" only if the username is "admin" **and** the password is "1234".
    
3. **The Fast-Pass:** Use a **conditional expression** (one-liner) to assign the string "Discount" to a variable `ticket_type` if an age variable is less than 12 or greater than 65. Otherwise, assign "Standard".
    
4. **The Countdown:** Write a **while loop** that starts at 10 and counts down to 1, then prints "Blast off!".
    
5. **The Type Checker:** Write a program that takes an input. Try to cast it to an `int`. If the user enters "10.5", will the `int()` cast work or crash? (Try to explain why based on the rules of floats vs ints).
