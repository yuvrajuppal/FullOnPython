In Python, an `if-else` statement is used to make decisions: it runs one block of code if a condition is true, and a different block if the condition is false.
## How `if-else` works

- Python checks the condition after `if`; if it evaluates to `True`, the indented block under `if` is executed.
- If the condition is `False`, Python skips the `if` block and runs the indented block under `else`.
- Both the `if` and `else` blocks must be indented (usually 4 spaces or 1 tab) to show which lines belong to which block.

```python
if condition:
    # code to run if condition is True
else:
    # code to run if condition is False

```

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are too young to vote.")
```

```python
marks = int(input("Enter your marks: "))
if marks >= 50:
    print("Congratulations! You passed.")
else:
    print("Sorry, you did not pass.")
```

```
Enter your marks: 75
Congratulations! You passed.
```

```
Enter your marks: 30
Sorry, you did not pass.
```
