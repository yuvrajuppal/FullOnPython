In Python, the `if-elif-else` ladder lets you check multiple conditions in order and execute different blocks of code depending on which condition is `True`.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-if-else/)

## What is `if-elif-else`?

- `if` checks the first condition; if it’s `True`, that block runs and the rest is skipped.
- `elif` (short for “else if”) checks additional conditions only if the previous `if`/`elif` was `False`.    
- `else` runs only if all the above `if` and `elif` conditions are `False`.

This is perfect when you have more than two choices (like grading, age categories, or menu options).

## Basic Syntax
```python
if condition1:
    # code to run when condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # code to run when condition1 is False but condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # code to run when condition1 and condition2 are False but condition3 is True
else:
    # code to run when all conditions are False
```

```python
marks = 78
if marks >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif marks >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif marks >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif marks >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"
print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
```
