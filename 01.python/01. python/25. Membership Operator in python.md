In Python, **membership operators** are used to test whether a value or variable is found within a sequence (such as a string, list, tuple, or dictionary).

They are incredibly readable—almost like writing a sentence in English—and they return a Boolean value: `True` or `False`.

### The Two Membership Operators

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`in`|Returns `True` if the value is **present** in the sequence.|`'a' in 'apple'` → `True`|
|`not in`|Returns `True` if the value is **not present** in the sequence.|`'z' in 'apple'` → `False`|

### How They Work Across Different Types

#### 1. Strings

It checks for substrings (even multiple characters).

Python

```
message = "Hello World"
print("Hello" in message)    # True
print("z" not in message)    # True
```

#### 2. Lists and Tuples

It checks if an individual element exists in the collection.

Python

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("banana" in fruits)    # True
print("orange" in fruits)    # False
```

#### 3. Dictionaries

**Crucial Note:** By default, Python checks the **keys**, not the values.

Python

```
user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

print("name" in user)        # True (it's a key)
print("Alice" in user)       # False (it's a value, not a key)

# To check values, use .values()
print("Alice" in user.values()) # True
```
