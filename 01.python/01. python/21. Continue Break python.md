In Python, `break` and `continue` are known as **loop control statements**. They allow you to change the flow of a loop (either `for` or `while`) based on a specific condition.

Think of them as the "emergency exit" and the "skip button" for your code.

## 1. The `break` Statement

The `break` statement **stops the loop entirely**. As soon as the program hits a `break`, it jumps out of the loop and moves on to the code that follows it.

**When to use it:** When you’ve found what you’re looking for or an error occurs, and there’s no need to keep looping.

### Example: Finding a specific item

Imagine you are searching for a specific book in a pile. Once you find it, you stop looking.

Python

```
books = ["Science", "History", "Mystery", "Cooking", "Art"]

for book in books:
    if book == "Mystery":
        print("Found the Mystery book! Stopping search.")
        break  # This exits the loop immediately
    print(f"Checking {book}...")

print("Done with the search.")
```

**Output:**

- Checking Science...
    
- Checking History...
    
- Found the Mystery book! Stopping search.
    
- Done with the search.

## 2. The `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement **skips the rest of the current iteration** and jumps straight to the next cycle of the loop. It doesn't kill the loop; it just says, "I'm skipping this specific one."

**When to use it:** When you want to ignore certain items (like bad data or specific values) but want to process everything else.

### Example: Skipping odd numbers

Suppose you only want to print even numbers from a list.

Python

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 != 0:
        continue  # Skip the rest of this code block for odd numbers
    print(f"Processing even number: {num}")
```

**Output:**

- Processing even number: 2
    
- Processing even number: 4
    
- Processing even number: 6

## Quick Comparison

|**Feature**|**break**|**continue**|
|---|---|---|
|**Action**|Terminates the loop.|Skips to the next iteration.|
|**Logic**|"I'm done here, let's leave."|"Skip this one, what's next?"|
|**Loop Status**|The loop stops.|The loop stays active.|
