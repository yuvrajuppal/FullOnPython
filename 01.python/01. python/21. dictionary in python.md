In Python, a **dictionary** is a collection of data stored in **key-value pairs**.

If a list is like a numbered row of lockers, a dictionary is like a real-life dictionary: you look up a specific "word" (the **key**) to find its "definition" (the **value**).

## 1. Key Characteristics

- **Ordered:** As of Python 3.7+, dictionaries maintain the order in which items are inserted.
    
- **Mutable:** You can add, remove, or change items after the dictionary is created.
    
- **Unique Keys:** Every key must be unique. If you try to use the same key twice, the second one will simply overwrite the first.
    
- **Key Requirements:** Keys must be immutable types (like strings, numbers, or tuples). Values can be anything.

## 2. Basic Syntax and Example

Dictionaries are defined using curly braces `{}` with keys and values separated by a colon `:`.

Python

```python
# Creating a dictionary for a car
car_info = {
    "brand": "Tesla",
    "model": "Model 3",
    "year": 2023,
    "colors": ["Red", "White", "Blue"] # Values can be lists!
}

# Accessing a value using its key
print(car_info["brand"])  # Output: Tesla
```

## 3. Common Operations

Here is how you interact with a dictionary in your daily coding:

### Adding or Updating

You don't need a special method to add a new item; just assign a value to a new key.

Python

```python
car_info["battery"] = "82 kWh"  # Adds a new key-value pair
car_info["year"] = 2024         # Updates the existing value for 'year'
```

### Removing Items

You can use `pop()` to remove a specific key or `del`.

Python

```python
car_info.pop("model")  # Removes 'model' and returns its value
```

### Looping through a Dictionary

You can loop through just keys, just values, or both.

Python

```python
# Printing all keys and values
for key, value in car_info.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

## 4. Why use a Dictionary over a List?

|**Feature**|**List**|**Dictionary**|
|---|---|---|
|**Access method**|By index (e.g., `list[0]`)|By label (e.g., `dict["name"]`)|
|**Best use case**|Ordered collections of items|Related data with specific labels|
|**Speed**|Slower to find items by value|Extremely fast to find items by key|

> **Pro Tip:** If you aren't sure if a key exists, use the `.get()` method (e.g., `car_info.get("owner")`). Instead of crashing your program with an error if the key is missing, it will simply return `None`.

## Example with All methods
```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
keys = my_dict.keys()  # returns dict_keys view
keys_list = list(keys)  # converts keys to a list
print(keys_list)  # Output: ['name', 'age', 'city']



capitals = {
"name":"yuvraj",
"age":"20",
"skills":"python"
}

print(capitals["name"])
print(capitals.get("name"))



  

capitals['name'] = "raju"
print(capitals)
capitals.update({'name':"lagan"})
student1["address"]="xyz"
print(capitals)

capitals.pop("skills")
# this via target

capitals.popitem()
# this remove the latest


a =capitals.keys()
for key in capitals.keys():
	print(capitals[key])


a =capitals.values()
print(a)


print(capitals.items())
# this gives a 2d list of tupples


for keys,value in capitals.items():
	print(f'{keys} : {value}')


```



```python
for key in my_dict:
    print(key)
    
keys_list = [key for key in my_dict]

```
