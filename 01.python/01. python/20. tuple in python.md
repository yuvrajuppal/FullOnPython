Tuples in Python are immutable, ordered collections of items, ideal for storing fixed data like coordinates or function return values. Unlike lists, they cannot be modified after creation, making them memory-efficient and faster for read-only scenarios

## Key Features
- **Immutable**: Once created, items can't be changed, added, or removed.
- **Ordered**: Elements maintain insertion sequence and support indexing from 0.
- **Heterogeneous**: Can hold mixed data types (e.g., strings, integers, lists).
- **Allow duplicates**: Same values can appear multiple times.

## Creating Tuples
Use parentheses `()` with comma-separated values, or the `tuple()` constructor.

```python
# Basic tuple
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits)  # ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

# Single-item tuple (needs trailing comma)
single = ("hello",)

# Empty tuple
empty = ()

# From list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)  # (1, 2, 3)
```


Tuples in Python have only two built-in methods due to their immutable nature: `count()` and `index()`. These are the basic methods you can call directly on a tuple object, along with common built-in functions like `len()` that work on them.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/tuples-in-python/)​

## Built-in Tuple Methods
- **count(value)**: Returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.
- **index(value, start=0, end=None)**: Returns the first index of the specified value; raises ValueError if not found.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4)

# Count occurrences
print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 3

# Find first index
print(my_tuple.index(2))  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple.index(2, 2))  # Output: 4 (starts searching from index 2)

# Length (built-in function)
print(len(my_tuple))  # Output: 6
```
